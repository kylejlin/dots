# This project uses code from d3

In the interest of providing attribution, I would like to note that as stated above, this project uses code form d3.

Though you won't find it in `package.json`, the Dots Editor uses code from [d3](https://github.com/d3/d3).

I didn't install the whole package, as it seemed extremely excessive, given I only needed one function. So I copied and pasted a few files from [d3-shape](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape) and [d3-path](https://github.com/d3/d3-path) and then adapted them to create `cardinalCurveGenerator`.

The files were licensed under BSD 3-Clause. The licenses can be found in this directory.
